# CV-DeployWithDjango

A comprehensive guide to deploying Machine Learning and Computer Vision models using Django on AWS EC2. The deployment procedure has been explained in detail, covering both the local development side and server side. README also includes steps to deploy the application using `django-admin`. The process might seem a bit tedious and full of small details but the main target here is to demonstrate the process of deploying ML model in a website using AWS EC2.

**Layout of the Tutorial**

1. Local/dev side
